<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The main goal of this analysis to provide insight and prediction using effective visualization and machine learning with NOAA’s data sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-wildfire" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Wildfire</h2>
<p>A wildfire is an uncontrolled/unplanned fire in an area of combustible vegetation occurring in rural areas. Depending on the type of vegetation present, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire or veld fire.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire">1</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div id="data-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Sets</h2>
<p>The data sets can be obtained from <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp">NOAA Storm Events</a><sup><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp">2</a></sup>. We will extract California data sets from 1996 to 2020 and make it tidy. The code can be found here at my <a href="https://github.com/ranalytica/personal_blog/tree/master/content/post">github repository</a>.</p>
<p>Documentation of the fields/column can be obtained from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/Storm-Data-Export-Format.docx">Data Description</a></p>
<p>Date range of Data Set:
<strong>1950-01-03, 2020-03-31</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="data-exploration" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<p>The data set has over 1.6 million of rows and 51 variables comprising of several weather events such as Tornado, Hail, Wildfire (rank # 25), Flooding, all within the properties of United States. Our goal is to deep dive into California Wildfire Events and see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildfire by days</li>
<li>Wildfire by Months</li>
<li>Wildfire by year</li>
<li>Wildfire Property and Crop damages</li>
<li>Can we predict future occurrence</li>
<li>Is there a difference during Covid19 lockdown from March/June 2020 vs. the past.</li>

<p>Length of wildfire in days is the difference of “Ending date of fire + 1 day” minus “Beginning date of fire” and is measured in days. We added 1 because if the date is equal they will produce zero and would not be reflected in out data.</p>
<p>Let’s see the date range of our filtered data set first:</p>

<h2>Wild Fire by State</h2>
<p>California leads and has 8,363 days of wildfires from 1996-2020. That’s almost 22 years of fire. These 8363 days of wildfires are occurring in different places in California. Our ranking changes as well compared to the “frequency vs. length of wildfire in days”.</p>
